### Study Comparing the MechaCar vs the Competition

The purpose of this project is to analize metrics from AutosRUs - the MechaCar - because production is suffering troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team progress, so the data analytic has to to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

For this assignment is requiered the following:

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.

* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
